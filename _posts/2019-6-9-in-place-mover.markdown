Good morning people (Or whatever it is for you future folk).  
Today I have released the In-Place Mover.  
In-Place Mover is a tool to move files and folders to new locations, while linking the new file to the old file's location.  
You can check out the source code at [https://github.com/craftxbox/In-Place-Mover](https://github.com/craftxbox/In-Place-Mover), or download it for yourself at [https://github.com/craftxbox/In-Place-Mover/releases](https://github.com/craftxbox/In-Place-Mover/releases)  
I personally recommend using this tool with apps with large installation folders to move their files off your main OS disk.
I Hope you all have a great day, and I will see you the next time I have software to release!
