Hello people, I hope you all have had a great new years.  
Today I officially announce the release of the No Commercial MIT License.  
The No Commercial MIT License is just how it sounds, MIT without commercial use, perfect for those who want a very open licence but also dont want others, or themselves from making money from their open source projects.  
A permanent link to the No Commercial MIT License and the full license text can (be found here)[https://craftxbox.com/ncmit/]  
Thank you for reading, and have a good day.
