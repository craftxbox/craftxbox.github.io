Hello all, over the past week or two, I have been working on a new application.  
Introducing: DTabs, the tabbed discord client.  
With DTabs, you can make several tabs with different (or the same!) accounts and switch between them.  
You can also inject custom CSS files to theme the client.  
View the [source code here](https://github.com/craftxbox/DTabs), or download the [latest release here](https://github.com/craftxbox/DTabs/releases/latest)
