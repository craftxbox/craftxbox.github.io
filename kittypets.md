Kittypets:  A New home  
Munchkin – A ginger munchkin breed cat  
Whiskers – A tortoiseshell cat with long whiskers   
Salem – Fluffy all-black cat  
PROLOUGE  
In the quiet of the night, the door flings open and a figure is standing in the doorway walking in with a cage in its paws.  
The figure lays food down in front of me and the other two cats.  
I eat the food and fall asleep. I wake up in a cage inside a Car with the two cats by my side  
CHAPTER 1  
Jolting awake the car abruptly stops and the doors slowly open and it’s our owner with a smile on her face.  
She picks up the cage Me, Munchkin and Whiskers are in.  
Carrying us into a house she says “Welcome to your new home kitties!” I say to the others “A new home? Why do we need a new home?”.  
Munchkin replies “I don’t know let’s explore as soon as we can”.  
Whiskers says “Yeah! That’s a good idea!”  
They are brought into the house and they are let out of the cage.  
Salem takes a look around the porch to find any food or water but found nothing edible.  
They find a door that they can push open and go through to reveal a huge area with stairs going upstairs, three food and water bowls, toys in a bucket that was knocked over, a huge scratching tree, a soft bed and much more.Whiskers goes over to the his food dish with his name engraved into it while Munchkin goes to play with some of the toys while I explore up the stairs to find our litter boxes and the Twoleg kit sitting on its bed pressing round buttons and moving thumb pads around our owner calls it “Playing Video games”
